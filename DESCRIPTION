Description: Produces the formula for calculating the determinant, as a function 
     of the elements of the matrix.  This formula is called the symbolic representation 
     of the determinant.  In other words, for the 2x2 matrix V we want a function to 
     return 'v11v22 – v12v21' for an unstructured, general 2x2 matrix and 'v11v22 – v12^2' 
     for a symmetric 2x2 matrix, and not the numeric values for a particular numeric matrix.
